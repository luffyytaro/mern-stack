    <p>NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and is based on the V8 JavaScript engine used in the Google Chrome web browser.
        With Node.js, developers can build scalable network applications and server-side applications using JavaScript, which is a popular and widely used programming language. NodeJS is event-driven and supports non-blocking I/O, which means that it is highly efficient and can handle a large number of simultaneous connections without blocking the execution of other tasks.</p>
